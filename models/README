a) nn_* models are neural network based potentials, trained with the MAISE code, and named as:

   nn_(system name: series of elements)_d(dimensionality of the dataset used for the training)__v(model version)

   e.g.:   nn_CuPdAg_d3_v0 is a NN model for the Cu-Pd-Ag ternary constructed using the 3D (bulk) dataset,
           nn_CuAg_d0_v0   is a NN model for the Cu-Ag system trained on the bulk and nanoparticle datasets.

   note:   1- version "0" models are the new generation of models constructed with maise-net script.
   	   2- versions indicated by "p" are those which are used in previous publications.



b) gp_* models are Gupta potential parameters, collected from the literature, and named as:

   gp_(system name: series of elements)_d(dimensionality of the system that model is prepared for)_v(model version)

   note:   1- GP models are collected from the literature (cited in the reference entry in the model file)
              and were originally for nanoparticles.
           2- The cut-off range of the models are adjusted to be usable for the bulk systems, hence gp_*_d3_* models are created.
